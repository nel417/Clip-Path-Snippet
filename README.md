# Clip-Path-Snippet<br>
I thought I would hop on the clip path trend and try and whip something up to make a site more dynamic. <br>
In this site I learned clip-path and its hover states to make the circle turn into a card and display info. <br>
Site is not responsive and is Best viewed on desktop using chrome, I just wanted to put up what I learned from playing around in clip-path using the circle() style. <br><br>

<h2>TO USE</h2>
1.) Hover over dots 1, 2 , 3. <br>
2.) On the dot 3 there are links that send you to my email, Github, and Linkedin. <br>
3.) Enjoy!

<h2>TO VIEW</h2> <br>
In action view the github link at: https://nel417.github.io/Clip-Path-Snippet/ <br>
A live demo on youtube at: https://youtu.be/s4UUwcHEsCo <br>

Feel free to use source code card on one of your projects, I think it would look awesome if implemented as a hamburger icon that expands to a circular bubble looking nav. <br>

Thank you!
